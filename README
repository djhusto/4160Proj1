Motivation: I chose pong because it was the first game we spoke about in the class.
It did not seem too confusing and pretty straightforward on how to approach, code, and separate into their appropriate MVC.

Reasoning: I chose to program it all into one file because I prioritized performance over structure. I wanted to create a
working system first then in future iterations of the game to maybe separate the files. I also chose to only have the ball move
after a key was pressed. I am really proud of that particular aspect as I thought it was really cool to have that interaction
with the user.

Known Bugs/Glitches:
After a point is scored. The ball continues on the same trajectory once it restarts.
    Fix: On the reset function, speed in both directions gets reset to default
          This should hopefully help with 

Future Improvement:
1. Separate the main.py file into separate ball, paddle, view, model, and controller classes. This helps with generalization
and being able to reuse file for future projects.
